 Bandwidth 

Given a graph (V,E) where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of arcs
in VxV, and an ordering on the elements in V, then the 
bandwidth of a node v is defined as the maximum distance in the
ordering between v and any node to which it is connected in the
graph. The bandwidth of the ordering is then defined as the maximum of
the individual bandwidths. For example, consider the following graph:

  

This can be ordered in many ways, two of which are illustrated below:

  

For these orderings, the bandwidths of the nodes (in order) are 6, 6,
1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 6 giving an ordering bandwidth of 6, and 5, 3, 1, 4, 3,
5, 1, 4 giving an ordering bandwidth of 5.


Write a program that will find the ordering of a graph that minimises
the bandwidth.

Input

Input will consist of a series of graphs. Each graph will appear on a
line by itself. The entire file will be terminated by a line
consisting of a single #.  For each graph, the input will consist of
a series of records separated by `;'. Each record will consist of a
node name (a single upper case character in the the range `A' to `Z'),
followed by a `:' and at least one of its neighbours. The graph will
contain no more than 8 nodes.

Output

Output will consist of one line for each graph, listing the ordering
of the nodes followed by an arrow (->) and the bandwidth for that
ordering. All items must be separated from their neighbours by exactly
one space. If more than one ordering produces the same bandwidth, then
choose the smallest in lexicographic ordering, that is the one that
would appear first in an alphabetic listing.

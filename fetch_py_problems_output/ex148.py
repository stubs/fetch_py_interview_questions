 Anagram checker 

It is often fun to see if rearranging the letters of a name gives an
amusing anagram. For example, the letters of `WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'
rearrange to form `SPEAK REALISM AWHILE'.


Write a program that will read in a dictionary and a list of phrases
and determine which words from the dictionary, if any, form anagrams
of the given phrases. Your program must find all sets of words in the
dictionary which can be formed from the letters in each phrase. Do not
include the set consisting of the original words. If no anagram is
present, do not write anything, not even a blank line.

Input

Input will consist of two
parts. The first part is the dictionary, the second part is the set of
phrases for which you need to find anagrams. Each part of the file
will be terminated by a line consisting of a single #. The dictionary
will be in alphabetic order and will contain up to 2000 words, one
word per line. The entire file will be in upper case, and no
dictionary word or phrase will contain more than 20 letters. You
cannot assume the language being used is English.

Output

Output will consist of a series of lines. Each line will consist of
the original phrase, a space, an equal sign (=), another space, and
the list of words that together make up an anagram of the original
phrase, separated by exactly one space. These words must appear in
alphabetic sequence.

Sample output

SXZYTWQP KLJ YRTD = DXZ K LJSRT PTYYWQ
SXZYTWQP KLJ YRTD = DXZ K LT PT Y YWJSRQ
SXZYTWQP KLJ YRTD = KX LJSRT PTYYWQ ZD
SXZYTWQP KLJ YRTD = KX LT PT Y YWJSRQ ZD

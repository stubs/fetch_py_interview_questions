 All Squares 

Geometrically, any square has a unique, well-defined centre point. On
a grid this is only true if the sides of the square are an odd number
of points long. Since any odd number can be written in the form 2k+1,
we can characterise any such square by specifying k, that is we can say
that a square whose sides are of length 2k+1 has size k. Now define a
pattern of squares as follows.

 The largest square is of size k (that is sides are of length 2k+1) and is
centred in a grid of size 1024 (that is the grid sides are of length
2049). The smallest permissible square is of size 1 and the largest is of
size 512, thus   . All squares of size k > 1 have a square of size k div 2 centred on
each of their 4 corners. (Div implies integer division, thus 9 div 2 =
4). The top left corner of the screen has coordinates (0,0), the bottom
right has coordinates (2048, 2048).


Hence, given a value of k, we can draw a unique pattern of squares
according to the above rules. Furthermore any point on the screen will
be surrounded by zero or more squares. (If the point is on the border
of a square, it is considered to be surrounded by that square). Thus
if the size of the largest square is given as 15, then the following
pattern would be produced.

  

Write a program that will read in a value of k and the coordinates of
a point, and will determine how many squares surround the point.

Input and Output

Input will consist of a
series of lines. Each line will consist of a value of k and the
coordinates of a point. The file will be terminated by a line
consisting of three zeroes (0 0 0).


Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the
input. Each line will consist of the number of squares containing the
specified point, right justified in a field of width 3.
